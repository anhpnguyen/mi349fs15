        <p> Welcome! My name is Anh Nguyen (On Win). I'm a Junior student at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Science Engineering.</p>
        <p>I'm loving my time here at MSU. Since I declared my major, I have been involving so computing communities such as MSU ACM and hackathons. I come to ACM meetings to learn about new technologies through tech talks and sometimes get help with my projects. About hackathons, I love everything about hackathon, including sleep deprivation because it's worth it. Hackathon is a great opportunity to not only learn about new technogies, but also get hands-on experience. I also like it when working with other student developers and continue to innovate and build more values from existing technologies. I also helped out at Sparta Hack, which is Michigan State's student-run hackathon, and at MythicsApp where I was part of the tech team.</p>
        <p>MSU has given me one of the best college experience I could ask for. And to make the most out of it, I have decided to study abroad in Denmark for Spring semester of 2016. I am accepted to Technical University of Denmark and I will continue to take major-related classes there as a full-time student. This venture to Europe is going to be excited and full of amazements. My goal there is to learn European technogies as much as I can and enjoy my time there both studying and travelling.</p> 
        <p>I like talking about future because it excited me and inspires me to do more things and keep my mind straight. I have accepted an internship offer at Crowe Horwath as a business analyst and performance consultant. I will be working in their Chicago office from June to August and needless to say, I'm very excited for such opportunity. I'm hoping to learning many things from the internship and finish it strong. When it ends, I will be going back to Vietnam for a few week to visit my relatives and continue exploring Asia because that's what I like doing.
